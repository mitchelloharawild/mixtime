\title{Generate sequences of mixtime values}
\usage{
\method{seq}{mt_cyclical}(from, to, by, length.out = NULL, along.with = NULL, ...)

\method{seq}{mt_linear}(from, to, by, length.out = NULL, along.with = NULL, ...)

\method{seq}{mixtime}(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{from}{Starting value of the sequence.}

\item{to}{End value of the sequence (if provided).}

\item{by}{Increment of the sequence. Can be:
\itemize{
\item An integer for the number of time units
\item A character string specifying the interval (e.g., "1 day", "2 weeks",
"1 month", "1 year")
\item A time unit object created with time unit functions (e.g., \code{tu_year(1L)},
\code{tu_month(1L)}, \code{tu_day(1L)})
}}

\item{length.out}{Desired length of the sequence (alternative to \code{to}).}

\item{along.with}{Take the length from this argument (alternative to \code{length.out}).}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to the underlying sequence method.}
}
\value{
A mixtime vector containing the sequence.
}
\description{
Create regular sequences of time values. This method handles both linear
time sequences (dates, date-times) and cyclical time sequences (day of week,
month of year).
}
\details{
For linear time types (Date, POSIXct, yearmonth, etc.), sequences progress
forward or backward in time. For cyclical time types (month_of_year,
day_of_week, etc.), sequences wrap around cyclically.

\examples{
# Linear time sequences with integer by
seq(yearmonth("2020 Jan"), yearmonth("2020 Dec"))
seq(yearquarter("2020-01-01"), length.out = 5, by = 3)

# Linear time sequences with string intervals
seq(yearmonthday("2020-01-01"), yearmonthday("2020-12-31"), by = "1 month")
seq(yearmonth("2020 Jan"), yearmonth("2025 Jan"), by = "1 year")
seq(yearmonthday("2020-01-01"), length.out = 10, by = "2 weeks")

# Linear time sequences with time units
seq(yearmonth("2020 Jan"), yearmonth("2020 Dec"), by = tu_month(2L))
seq(yearmonthday("2020-01-01"), length.out = 5, by = tu_year(1L))
seq(yearmonthday("2020-01-01"), yearmonthday("2020-01-31"), by = tu_day(7L))

# Cyclical time sequences
seq(month_of_year(0L), month_of_year(11L))
seq(month_of_year(5L), month_of_year(3L), by = tu_month(2L))
seq(day_of_week(0L), day_of_week(6L), by = 1)
